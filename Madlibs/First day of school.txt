{3}, {3}, {3}! The alarm clock was telling {0} it was time

pretty {4} about it. This was his first day at {5} junior high.

{0} got off the {6}, {7} school bus and was heading toward the
front door of the school when he saw his friend {2}. {2} was 
wearing his favorite {8} shirt. "Nice shirt!" said {0}. They 
headed into the school together.

"What is your first class?" asked {2}. "I have {9} with Mr.
{1}" replied {0}. "That's too bad" said {2}, "He's grades
everyone on their {11} ability." Then the bell rang and
they went off to class.

{0} just sat down in his chair when Mr. {1} called on him.
"{0} what is the capital of {10}?" he asked. {0} wasn't sure
